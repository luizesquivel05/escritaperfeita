        <p class="conteudo">
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vivara in the Mara Colony is a literary work that aims to present the central idea -> to talk about Literary Theory in a simple, objective, and accessible way to all audiences. <br> <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through this work, it becomes public that life and all work are within literary theory, criticizing its attempts at objectification and subordination that academies impose against theories; it is, above all, a critical work. <br> <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If literary theory is meant to study <strong>literature</strong>, then why should we confine ourselves within our libraries and academies? Literary theory must overcome barriers, discuss literary themes. Hunger, thirst, human misery, inequality... These are human and literary themes. How could we conceive of a literary theory that would distance itself from them? <br> <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an objective and synthesized way, the work is situated in a context where Vivara's world is living normally, without major events or milestones: we are not in crisis or wars, but we are also not in great moments of growth or proliferation. <br> <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, there is a Canaanite, just one among the many Canaanites who live on the margins of society, forgotten and ignored. His name is Lucexander, and throughout the chapters, he travels through Vivara, getting to know each of the nacaroes and seeking answers to his many questions. <br> <br>
